				<h3>Syracuse parking violations increase near greek life houses during summer months</h3>
				<h4> Parking violations increase around Syracuse greek life houses even though the student population decreases. </h4> 
				<h4> <br> Sunny Suaya </h4>

			<div class="col-md"id= "assign_text1">
				<h3> <br>  Syracuse University has an affluent greek life presence with over twenty greek houses surrounding the college. <br> <br> A select number of members are permitted to live in the greek life residence throughout the school year. Whereas other members visit the houses for events, chapter meetings and friendly get togethers. Students' involvement in greek life definitely shapes their daily routines but how does greek life impact parking violations? </h3>

				<h3> <br> After analyzing the data on Syracuse, New York parking violations in the past year, an increase in ticketing around the following addresses was found. All of these adresses are near greek life houses. </h3>
			<div id= "assign_text2">
				<h3> <br> - 1210 Harrison Street <br> - 304 Walnut Place <br> - 306 Walnut Place <br> - 703 Walnut Ave <br> - 803 Walnut Ave <br> - 901 Walnut Ave <br> - 743 Comstock Ave </h3>

				<p>The highest amount of violations come from 803 Walnut ave, the address of the sorority Gamma Phi Beta. This sorority neighbors a fraternity (Delta Tau Delta, formerly resided by Delta Upsilon). </p>

				<p> <br> Olivia Gambino, member and Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion of Syracuse’s Alpha Phi explains how although she lives in her sorority house, parking is not provided. When she needs to have her vehicle nearby, she will park her car on the street infront or across from her sorority house. <br> <br> Gambino states, “I’ve accumulated a decent amount of parking violations in the past year, I believe I have six right now. I owe like $300 worth of parking fees and I received all of them after parking in front of the greek life houses on Walnut”. Gambino further explained that she overuses her parking meter time due to the congestion around the houses and limited parking options.</p>

				
				<p> <em> <b> However, this data is from an entire year. So, what happens around the houses when students go home for summer break? </b> </em> </p>

			<div>	
				<p> <br> As the graph above illustrates, the number of parking violations during the academic school year and summer months is nearly split. </p>

				<p> The summer period includes May, June and July whereas the academic year is a nine month span. Since the number of violations during the shorter summer period is almost equal to or higher than the number of violations in the longer academic year, it can be concluded that there is an increase in summer violations.</p>

				</div>


			<div> 
				<div id = "mom" > <h4> <b> Sigma Delta Tau: House 'Mom' </b> </h4> 

				<p> <br> Pauly Magee, the house director of Syracue’s Sigma Delta Tau sorority, who lives at the residence for all 12 months of the calendar year. Magee expressed that she was not surprised by the parking increase over the summer months. </p>

 				<p>“People don’t realize it, they see a place, they know it's summer and so they’re going to park there. Students have an eye for stealing parking places, if there's an opening they are going to go and there's still people at Syracuse in those months.” says Magee. </p> 

 			</div>

 		<div>
 			<p> Although campus isn’t as bustling as it usually is May-July, there are still many people occupying the surrounding areas. From working staff to students taking classes <a href= "https://www.syracuse.edu/academics/other-academic-opportunities/summer/"> during the summer</a> to even high school students participating in <a href= "https://precollege.syr.edu/?_gl=1*ltq1tr*_gcl_au*NTg5MTY3MDk4LjE3MzI5MzAxMDc.*_ga*Mjc2NjkyOTk4LjE2ODk4ODI2NDU.*_ga_JYZJL3F4BE*MTczMzcwMTQ0Ni4xNi4wLjE3MzM3MDE0NDYuNjAuMC4w*_ga_QT13NN6N9S*MTczMzcwMTQ0Ni44My4wLjE3MzM3MDE0NDcuNTkuMC4w"> pre-college sessions. </a> </p>
 		</div>

 		<div>
 		<p> Those residing near greek houses during the summer may just be acting out of opportunity like Magee explained. When an open spot is available so close to campus, vehicle owners are destined to take advantage. </p>

 		<p> Additionally, usually only the house directors live in the houses after the academic year is over. Thus, creating an opening of spaces. </p>

 		<p>After taking a look at the city of Syracuse’s parking rules, there are also different laws depending on zomes that change during particular hours. Those who don’t live in the houses may not be as aware of the rules, resulting in more violations. </p>

 		<p> Syracuse University has its own <a href= "https://parking.syr.edu/"> Parking and Transportation Services </a> which enforces their policies year round, even May-July.  Most spots on campus require a parking permit or sticker where others require you to pay a meter fee. </p> </div>

 		 <div class="col-lg-12">
				<img class = "img-fluid" src = "visual2.png" alt = "table"> 
		</div>	
		
 		<p> The table above shows the status of the parking violations given in the locations listed. Demonstrating the enforcement of the tickets given out and the consequences for violating parking rules. Being that many of the tickets go to collections, violators could experience even greater consequences. </p>


 		<p> In the rare case that there is free street parking, there are specific rules advertised by signage. For instance, even-odd parking, overnight rules and time-limited spots. </p>

 		<p> To decrease the amount of violations, Syracuse drivers should make an effort to familiarize themselves with the <a href= "https://www.syr.gov/Departments/PVB/Parking-Rules"> parking laws, </a> street signage and legal openings despite the time of the year. </p>


 		<p> According to <a href= "https://mwg.aaa.com/via/car/taking-car-college#:"> “AAA” </a> (or triple ‘A’), “More than 19.9 million students enrolled in college nationwide in 2018, and about half bring a car with them to school.”  Whereas <a href= "https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/syracuse-university-2882#:" > US News states, </a> “30% of Syracuse students are involved in Greek life.” 

 		<p> With these statistics, it is shown that although greek life attracts 30% of Syracuse students to their houses on a daily basis, this is not enough to cause a great disproportion in parking violations in terms of during the school year virus off summer months. </p>

 		<p> All of these findings depict that the number of parking violations around greek life houses is not directly related to the student population in the houses or on campus. Rather, the issue may result from something that runs deeper within the Syracuse community’s parking policies. Thus, anyone planning to park near campus, during the school year or summer months, should be aware of the policies surrounding them to avoid receiving a violation. </p>
